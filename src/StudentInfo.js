    introduction:
      'The self-proclaimed "Boss" (i.e. president) of Club Problem Solver 68, Aru is a 2nd year student at Gehenna Academy. She conducts her illegal business however she pleases. While Aru always puts on a cool, beauteous, and villainous façade, she has a habit of breaking character often and exposing her true personality when teased or pressured. Despite the vain and conceited persona she wears, Aru is meticulous and caring for the people she is close to. There is definitely more to her than she lets on. Will you be the one to find out what secrets she may hold close?',
    personality:
      "Aru puts on airs and pretends to have the attitude of a bigshot boss. She can come off as pretentious or pompous to others but has a soft and caring side underneath the cold surface. Aru tries to be thoughtful while also being haughty but her lack of knowledge and experience makes it easy for her exterior to crumble. In some ways, she is just like many students her age - putting on a show to hide her softer and naïve side.",
    appearance:
      'Aru is 5"2 or 157 cm. She has long, straight shoulder-length pink hair with bangs that cast shadows over her eyes. This lends itself to her defining trait: the appearance of a villainess or a demon queen. This is augmented by her haughty and pretentious smile and the horns that grow out of the rear of her head. It should be noted that it is unclear if the horns are a part of her body or if they are a part of her coat. Observing how she appears in the 3rd PV, which shows her in her uniform without her coat, the horns are not part of the coat.',
    haloInfo:
      "Aru's halo has a smaller circle slightly slanted to her left. A larger disfigured circle with dashed edges and stripes on both side surrounds the first circle. The second circle resembles a crescent moon. When looking at the inner and outer circle together, her halo somewhat resembles an eye.",
    uniform:
      "Aru wears a red Captain's coat with golden buckles, a long-sleeved collared white shirt, a red ribbon around her neck, and an office skirt with gold-strapped high heels.",
    firearmInfo:
      "The old-fashioned design of this sniper rifle is something that Aru cherishes. It seems just by having it, it increases her hard-boiledness.",
    uniqueItemInfo:
      "Aru's favorite luxury wallet. It is a luxury item made of high quality materials, but the color has faded and there are scratches here and there due to long use. It was given to her by Haruka, Kayoko, and Mutsuki after she first set up her own handyman business, and is an irreplaceable treasure for Aru.",
